# Facebook Conversions API Tag for Google Tag Manager Server Container

You can use this tag for the Google Tag Manager Server Side container to set up Facebook Conversion API.

It works based on Universal Analytics or Google Analytics 4 requests inside the Google Tag Manager Server Side container.
Also, it supports custom [Data client](https://github.com/stape-io/data-client) that allows retrieving Data Layer from web containers easier.

Facebook Conversion API (previously Facebook server-side tracking) has the same purpose as Facebook pixel - it tracks what users are doing on your site.
But the difference between web and server tracking is that pixel requests are processed in the userâ€™s browser, while Facebook conversion API works through the cloud server.
